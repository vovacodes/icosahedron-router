# Icosahedron Router

Router implementation, extends Backbone.Router, allows to map route handlers
to the methods of another object (a la Marionette.Approuter) and provides 'beforeRoute'
hook that could be used for implementing custom initializationlogic or route
filtering (a la Backbone.Routefilter).

Please use tests as a documentation.
