# Icosahedron Router

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/wizardzloy/icosahedron-router.png)](https://travis-ci.org/wizardzloy/icosahedron-router#)

Router implementation, extends __['ampersand-router']('https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-router')__, allows
to map route handlers to the methods of another object (a la Marionette.Approuter) and provides 'beforeRoute'
hook that could be used for implementing custom initialization logic or route filtering (a la Backbone.Routefilter).

Please use tests as a documentation.
